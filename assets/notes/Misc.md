### Questions

1. **Why you wanna become a web devloper?**

I like coding because it's an ever growing field. And if you're not growing you're dying. I love learning new things, creating new ideas, and watching them come together. Seeing that blank canvas turn into something beautiful that millions of people can see is awesome. 


2. **What is responsive website?**

When a website responds to the size of the screen it's viewed on, itâ€™s called a *responsive* website.


3. **How can we make one?**
- Using flexbox instead of traditional box.
- using relative units of measurement for eg. rem, em, % etc.
- Using media queries.


4. **What are media queries?**

CSS uses *media queries* to adapt a website's content to different screen sizes. With media queries, CSS can detect the size of the current screen and apply different CSS styles depending on the width of the screen.

### Questions to ask interviewer

Q1. Is there room to grow into higher level positions ?

Q2. Do you offer option to work remotely ?

Q3. can you tell me about how a project typically goes.
